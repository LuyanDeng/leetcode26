# 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

### Brute Force 
Since this problem ask for the minimum length of a subarray that has a sum larger or equal to the target value. We can first has for loop start with i to iterate the array (0,len(nums)), i is the starting point the subarray. 
and j is the ending point of the subarray. the for loop range is (i, len(nums))
and keep the minimum length of the subarray

```python
  
    i = 0
    j =0  
    n = len(nums)
    min_len = float('inf')

    for i in range(n):
        
        curr_sum = 0
        
        for j in range(i,n):
            curr_sum += nums[j]
            if curr_sum >= target:
                min_len = min(min_len, j-i+1)
                break


   return min_len if min_len!= float('inf') else 0
